  "description": "Were it not for the calculus, mathematicians would have no way to describe the acceleration of a motorcycle or the effect of gravity on thrown balls and distant planets, or to prove that a man could cross a room and eventually touch the opposite wall. Just how calculus makes these things possible and in doing so finds a correspondence between real numbers and the real world is the subject of this dazzling book by a writer of extraordinary clarity and stylistic brio. Even as he initiates us into the mysteries of real numbers, functions, and limits, Berlinski explores the furthest implications of his subject, revealing how the calculus reconciles the precision of numbers with the fluidity of the changing universe. \"An odd and tantalizing book by a writer who takes immense pleasure in this great mathematical tool, and tries to create it in others.\"--New York Times Book Review",

We hope that they will provide you with new ways of looking at a novel produced by an American realist hailed by critics as one of her generation's finest writers. With this work, Mona Simpson shows herself to be a sensitive and incisive analyst of the broken family, with an uncommon insight into the child who is at the mercy of parents who are absent, restless, narcissistic, dishonest or emotionally unstable. While it engages serious contemporary social issues, this work also makes for compulsive and deeply enjoyable reading, with characters who absorb our attention and involve us completely in their world.",

Since those first sightings, Lisa has seen and communicated with thousands of people who have passed over, listening to their stories and delivering messages of comfort to the loved ones they left behind.In Life Among the Dead, Lisa invitesreaders into her extraordinary life, from her childhood in Birmingham, England, where her grandmother -- also a renowned psychic -- encouraged her to respect and nurture her talent, to her decision to move to Los Angeles, where her smash-hit Lifetime television show quickly made her one of the world's most beloved mediums. Lisa shares memories of her earliest psychic experiences and her gradual acceptance of her gift, and recalls many of the amazingly accurate communications she has shared with believersand skeptics alike. In her compassionate, down-to-earth style, she reveals exactly what it's like to live surrounded by spirits every day, and she recounts the joy she feels in bringing solace to those who have lost someone dear and the insights she has gleaned about spiritual phenomena,hauntings, psychic healing, and the afterlife. Warm, witty, and surprising, Life Among the Dead is a wonderfully intimate account of Lisa's life as a medium, healer, wife, mom, and TV star who has already won the hearts of millions,a woman with an astonishing gift for seeing beyond the ordinary and into a mysterious and fascinating realm.",

  "description": "New York City in the boomtown 1980s: land values skyrocketing, new buildings going up on every block, fortunes being made overnight - and extorted in the morning. On the streets of Hell's Kitchen, the construction rackets are in the hands of the Irish mob. It's always been their turf; now it's their time. And the stakes are higher than ever before - which explains the sudden interest in the Irish on the part of both the Mafia and the feds (led by a female agent trapped by the necessity to prove what she is clearly capable of), and the growing struggle for position and profit within the mob itself, an internecine war that finally ignites in the back rooms and broad daylight of the neighborhood.At the heart of the story are the Adare brothers: Paddy, a failed boxer turned mob henchman who's never left the streets he grew up on and who, at thirty-two, is beginning to pay the price for years of living large; and Billy, a college graduate, back home for the summer to work in the tunnels as a sandhog before he enters law school and gets himself out of the old neighborhood and in on the American dream - brothers divided by everything but their powerful blood-tie. Now, as their paths converge on familiar streets in a cross fire of greed, treachery, and violence, their loyalties - to family, friends, neighborhood, and, most important, each other - will be put to a brutal and profoundly telling test.",

With a voice that is as charming as it is recognizable, Evelyn immerses the reader in the dramas of an entire community. The people of Kerrville, stuck at once in the middle of nowhere but also at the center of everything, are the source from which Moriarty draws on universal dilemmas of love and belief to render a story that grows in emotional intensity until it lifts the reader to heights achieved only by the finest of fiction.",

Then comes the day when Jon and Ilana fail to return home from her ballet recital. His bullet-ridden car is found empty on the side of the road hours later. Elise, in the last stages of a difficult pregnancy, desperately calls her grandmother Leah in America for help and unknowingly revives a decades-old oath that transcends both time and place. Over the course of five terror- and hope-filled days, ordinary people join the front lines against terrorism, and the ties that bind two generations forge a potent alliance against contemporary evil.",

Part thriller, part dystopian science fiction, The thousand takes the reader on a spine-tingling ride from Las Vegas to Chicago, from ancient Greece to modern America. With a painstakingly constructed conspiracy based on followers of Pythagoras, The Thousand is the story, above all, of a young woman's efforts to tell truth from lies as a network of powerful people tries to use her for its own gain. If you're like me, you'll stay up all night until all the pieces fall into place.\"---Sara Paretsky, author of Hardball\"Part thught-provoking mystery, part flat-out thriller, The Tousand is superb. Kevin Guilfoile's second novel is every bit as inventive---Umberto Eco meets Stan Lee---and well crafted as his first, which is saying something. Guilfoile patiently develops an array of unique characters and adroitly weaves them into a provocative, relentless labyrinth of a story. It's a rare treat---a book to savor, contemplate, and admire.\" ---Stephen White, author of The Stege\"Kevin Guilfoile is a writer of stunning talent.\"---James Rollins, author of The Doomsday KeyKevin Guilfoile is a terrific new novelist with guts, brains, wit, and imagination... Guilfoile is a bright new star in the crime fiction universe, but so much more than that.\"---C.J. Box, Edgar Award winner and author of Bellow ZeroKevin Guilfoile's rivering follow-up to Cast of Shadows (\"spellbinding\"---Chicago Tribune; \"a masterpiece of intelligent plotting\"---Slon) centers on an extraordinary young wonman's race to find her Father's killer and to free herself from the cross fire of a centuries-old civil war in which she has unknowingly become ensnared.In 530 B.C., a mysterious ship appeared off the rainy shores of Croton, in what is now Italy. After thre days the skies finally cleared and a man disembarded to address the curious and frightened crowd that had gathered along the wet sands. He called himself Pythagoras. Exactly what he said that day is unknown, but a thousand men and women abandoned their lives and families to follow him. they became a community. A school. A cult dedicated to the search for a mathematical theory of everything. Although Pythagoras would die years later, following a bloody purge, his disciples would influence Western philosophy, science, and mathematics for all time.Chicago, the present day. Canada Gold, a girl both gifted and burdened by uncanny mental abilities, is putting her skills to questionable use in the casinos and courthouses of Las Vegas when she finds herself drawn back to the city in which her father, the renowned coposer Solomon Gold, was killed while composing his magnum opus. Beautiful, brilliant, troubled, Canada has never heard of the Thousand, a clandestine group of powerful individuals safeguarding and exploiting the secret teachings of Pythagoras. But as she struggles to understand her father's unsolved murder, she finds herself caught in the violence erupting between members of the fractured ancient cult while she is relentlessly pursued by those who want to use her those who want to kill her, and the one person who wants to save her.BR>In an irresistibly ambitious novel that fuses historical fact with contemporary suspense, Kevin Guilfoile delivers an erudite, propulsively entertaining thriller that seamlessly traverses the realms of math, science, music, and philosophy. the Thousand is ringing confirmation of Guilfoile's enormous talent.",

  "description": "Psychologist and mother Madeline Levine looks at the history of television and movie violence in the United States. She translates into everyday language the results of over four decades of research on the effects of media violence - research that up until now has been inaccessible to most parents. Using a \"developmental approach,\" Dr. Levine helps parents understand that children at different ages think about, understand, and experience the world in very different ways. An appreciation of these differences in how children \"see\" things is critical if parents are to make wise choices about what is appropriate and what is potentially harmful to their children. Using research findings, common sense, and personal experience, Dr. Levine demonstrates that violence is not generic - and neither are children: the movie that may be instructive and appropriate for an eleven-year-old may be traumatic and overwhelming for a seven-year-old. Parents frequently underestimate the impact of violent television on their children and may be surprised at what children find upsetting.Dr. Levine argues that the issue of media violence is not trivial, that our society is increasingly at risk not only for higher levels of violence but for a greater tolerance and acceptance of this violence. In spite of efforts from both sides of the political spectrum to claim media violence as a political issue, Dr. Levine insists this is a parenting and citizenship issue. She looks at how parents, government, schools, and the media itself can best approach the problem. The book concludes with a list of resources to help parents become active in media reform.",

The battered body of Boulder County District Attorney Royal Peterson lies amid shards of broken pottery while his wife sleeps upstairs. Within hours, a homicide detective is the prime suspect in the brutal death that will send shock waves through the city - and reverberate in the professional and personal life of Alan Gregory.Alan knew Roy Peterson. Lauren, his wife, a prosecutor in the DA's office, worked under Peterson for years. And while Lauren contemplates taking on the defense of the accused cop, Alan meets with a new patient. Almost from the moment Naomi Bigg starts talking, warning bells go off in Alan's mind. A terrified mother with an explosive secret, Naomi tests the limits of doctor-patient confidentiality when her privileged exchanges convince Alan that a crime is about to be committed. But when he uncovers a shocking link to the Peterson slaying, Alan finds himself riding the slippery slope between professional judgment and personal responsibility as he struggles to protect his patient while probing the mind of a deeply troubled teenager.As violence erupts throughout the city - and a pattern of vengeance becomes chillingly clear - Alan is plunged into a desperate manhunt for a killer whose trail of rage winds all the way up to the Colorado Supreme Court. As the minutes tick down in a brilliantly conceived vendetta that targets the guilty and the innocent alike, Warning Signs races to a climax in which the lives of hundreds hang in the balance.",
